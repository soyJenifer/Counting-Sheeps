In this project I am practicing a little on how to use JavaScript by creating a function, try that, in this case, the "True" are the sheep and the "False" are the wolves that want to eat them. 
The function will receive a list of boolean values ​​and it has to count how many sheep there are or how many were eaten by wolves. ;)
